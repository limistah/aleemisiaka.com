The error:
```bash
tar (child): xz: Cannot exec: No such file or directory
```
Is majorly an issue with the xz command not found on the host machine.

To verify run
```bash
whereis xz
```



To fix, use the installation command for your linuz distribution:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xz-utils          # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo yum install xz                    # RHEL / CentOS
sudo zypper in xz                      # OpenSuSE
sudo pacman -S xz                      # Arch Linux
```


Then untar again with:

```bash
tar -xf path_to_file.tar.xz
```
