JavaScript is an interesting language and has a lot of reason why you should bet on it everyday, one genuine reason that could make you place a bet on the language is NodeJS. NodeJS is a runtime for JavaScript, and has helped JavaScript move from its primary domain (browsers) to the server.

With NodeJS comes variants of new concepts, one of which is NPM - Node Package Manager. While NPM houses modules and libraries that has been built on Node, it also serve as a dependency manager for NodeJS applications and programs.

Express is one of the packages written for NodeJS. The primary purpose of express is creating a server that could listen and respond to http requests. This is interesting to note, that JavaScript could also turn out to be a language that could snap out a web server.

In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to use ExpressJS to create and listen to http requests. This would be a basic server and would only do a few things, to help us move further, I will list resources to help us advance our knowledge and packages that improves the ExpressJS applications.

Alright, to begin with, let us install NodeJS from (here)[https://nodejs.org/en/download/]. When you have completed that, try testing your installation from the terminal using:
```bash
node -v
```
The code above should output the version of your NodeJS installation.

With every NodeJS installation, NPM is included as a command line utility for NodeJS applications. You can verify this by checking the version of the NPM packaged with the NodeJS distribution you installed:
```bash
npm -v
```

Now that we have NPM and NodeJS installed, we can start with creating our ExpressJS application.
