If you have used WhatsApp, Facebook Chat, then you have one way or the other interacted with an Erlang backed system.

Erlang is a language created for telecommunication industry by _Erlang Creator_ at _Erlang Creation Space_. It was recorded that Jor Armstrong claimed he was provided a library and did not know what to do with it, then they taught to solve the reliability and concurrent problem of the telecommunication industry, and that gave birth to Erlang.

The strength of Erlang lies in running scalable applications in a Distributed environment. It allows computers to network with each other with a very little overhead on the programmer and the operating system.

We are not here to battle why Erlang is the great concurrent programming language, we are here to envagalize about its syntax and way of thinking.

In this posts, we would be getting a formal introduction to Erlang and we are just covering the basics. Below is a list of what to expect:

- [Installation and Initialization](#installation-and-initialization)
- [Variables and pattern matching](#variables-and-pattern-matching)
- Funcs
- Modules
- Types
- Records
- Maps
- Processes
- Processes communication
- Distributed system

What we won't cover is the whole of the OTP framework. In the future, we would be having a post about this, for now, _let's learn some Erlang_!

## Installation and Initialization

For a thorough guide on how to install Erlang runtime on different platforms, checkout [Bruce Yinhe's post on medium](https://medium.com/@brucifi/erlang-quick-install-a3b7fd96947f) about this.

After a successful installation, open a terminal/CMD, and type in `erl`,
a default welcome message and prompt should be seen. Great, welcome to the Erlang world.

## Variables and pattern matching

If you have worked with other languages like JavaScript, Java, Python etc, you would be surprised by what Erlang understands as variable. In Erlang, variables starts with uppercase letter, thus, `C`, `X`, `Ape`, `Ant` are all valid identifiers for Erlang variables. Variables can not start with lowercase letter and begin with a number, Erlang variables can include can alphanumeric characters, an underscore and @ symbol.

```erl
X = 1. %% Valid
y = 2. %% Invalid
1X = 2. %% Invalid
```

When _assigning_ to a variable - as we do call it in other languages, Erlang actually does something called pattern matching. Comparing the values on the right to the values on the left. A pattern match would only succeed if they two operands match, thus, in Erlang, a variable get assigned to if it is either `unbound` or has the same value as the value at the right.

The `=` is a special symbol that does not do assignment but makes the pattern matching operation to be successful if its conditions are met. Hence, in Erlang `=` is known as a pattern match operator which evaluates the value of the right hand side (RHS) then matching the result with the left hand side (LHS)

```erlang
X = 1. %% successful
Y = 2. %% successful
Z = X + 1. %% successful

Z. %% => 3

Z = 3 %% successful
Z = 4 %% fails
```

There is no thing as global or private scope in Erlang, all variables are lexically scoped and are unrelated even if they exists in different functions;
