Without JavaScript, CSS can make dynamic UI possible with its user action selectors.

For example, A the help for the input element is only visible when its input is focused.

```html
<div class="input-cont">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Focus me" autofocus />
  <span class="help" data-help="Enter your email"></span>
</div>
```

To achieve the above, a `span` holding the help text in a `data-help` attribute as a sibling to the actual input. Both the input and the span are children to a parent div with class name `input-cont`.

The container would help to proper place the content, so a position relative is applied. Since multiple inputs can exist on a page, a margin-bottom is added to give a visual cue and separation.

```css
.input-cont {
  position: relative;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

input {
  z-index: -1;
}
```

To achieve toggling on focused, we would use the before pseudo element for an element. Since input is not a container element, therefore can not have a before and after pseudo elements, we would use the span in its place.

The `+`(direct sibling) selector can achieve selecting an element that lives under the same parent as the base selector.

Here, the input and the span.help lives under the same parent, so `input+.help` gets the span.help element, and the `::before` gives access to its pseudo selector.

The `z-index: -2` ensure that the `::before` pseudo element stay behind the input field, also, the content `property` is not set, yet not to make the element visible immediately.

````css
input + .help::before {
  bottom: 50%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 0px;
  color: #707070;
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
  filter: blur(5px);
  z-index: -2;
}
```

To show the help text when an element is hidden, the `:focus` psuedo selector is used to select an input that is focused, then the sibling selecor gives access to the `span.help` element, which makes the `span.help::before` pseudo element stylable.

Here, the content is set by picking it from the `data-help` attribute on the span.help element, a final `z-index: 0` is applied to bring the `span.help::before` element on top of the input field, while the `bottom: 60%` pushes the element downward below the input field to avoid overlapping.

```css
input:focus+.help::before {
  content: attr(data-help);
  opacity: 1;
  filter: blur(0);
  bottom: -60%;
  z-index: 0;
  font-size: 12px;
}
````

And this is just a basic toggling and hiding of elements using :focus.

Many interesting things can be built with CSS user action selectors.

There are other action selectors are:

- :active
- :focus
- :focus-within
- :focus-visible
- :hover
